7qr is the link management tool for modern marketing teams. With 7qr, you can create, share, and track short links using your own [custom domain](how-to-add-custom-domain).

<Note variant="info">
  Fun fact: The name **7qr** comes from the literal definition of the word
  **"dub"** – which is to "give an unofficial name or nickname to something" (_a
  là what 7qr does with longer URLs_).
