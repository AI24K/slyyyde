  </Step>

  <Step title="Install `@dub/analytics` to your project">
    Using the package manager of your choice, add the `@dub/analytics` to your project.

    <CodeGroup>

      ```bash npm
      npm install @dub/analytics
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add @dub/analytics
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add @dub/analytics
      ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use `<Analytics />` in your project">
    If you are using React, you can use the `<Analytics />` component to track conversions on your website.

    You can add the `<Analytics />` component to your root layout component or any other pages where you want to track conversions.

    ```jsx
      import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from '@dub/analytics/react';

      export default function RootLayout({
        children,
      }: Readonly<{
        children: React.ReactNode;
      }>) {
        return (
          <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
            <DubAnalytics />
          </html>
        );
      }
    ```

    You can use the `inject()` function to add the tracking script to other frameworks.

    ```jsx
      import { inject } from '@dub/analytics';

      inject();
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Track conversions">
    Dub Analytics will now track conversions on your website. You can view the conversion data in the Dub dashboard.

## Available Props

You can pass the following props to the `<Analytics />` component to customize the tracking script.

#### cookieOptions

The `cookieOptions` prop allows you to customize the cookie that is set by the tracking script. The following properties are available:

<ResponseField name="cookieOptions">
  <Expandable title="properties">
| Key   | Default | Description | Example |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `domain` | `null` | Specifies the value for the `Domain` Set-Cookie attribute. | `example.com` |
| `expires` | 90 days from now | Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the `Expires` Set-Cookie attribute. | `new Date('2024-12-31')` |
| `expiresInDays` | `90` | Specifies the number (in days) to be the value for the `Expires` Set-Cookie attribute. | `90` |
| `httpOnly` | `false` | Specifies the boolean value for the `HttpOnly` Set-Cookie attribute. Be careful when setting this to true, as compliant clients will not allow client-side JavaScript to see the cookie in `document.cookie`. | `true` |
| `maxAge` | `null` | Specifies the number (in seconds) to be the value for the `Max-Age` Set-Cookie attribute. | `3600` |
| `path` | `/` | Specifies the value for the `Path` Set-Cookie attribute. By default, the path is considered the "default path". | `/` |
| `sameSite` | `Lax` | Specifies the boolean or string to be the value for the `SameSite` Set-Cookie attribute. | `strict` |
| `secure` | `false` | Specifies the boolean value for the `Secure` Set-Cookie attribute. | `true` |

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

For example, to set a cross domain cookie, you can use the following code:

```tsx
import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from "@dub/analytics";

<DubAnalytics
  cookieOptions={{
    domain: process.env.IS_PRODUCTION_ENV
      ? ".yourdomain.com" // for cross-domain tracking
      : undefined,
  }}
/>;
```
