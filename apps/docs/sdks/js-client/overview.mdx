    ```jsx
      import { Analytics as DubAnalytics } from '@dub/analytics/react';

      export default function RootLayout({
        children,
      }: Readonly<{
        children: React.ReactNode;
      }>) {
        return (
          <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
            <DubAnalytics />
          </html>
        );
      }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Track conversions">
    Dub Analytics will now track conversions on your website. You can view the conversion data in the Dub dashboard.
